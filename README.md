## Installation
Install npm packages as usual.

## Usage
Install the seeds with "npm run seed," and the server with "npm run watch" (for nodemon). Once you open the app, choose to continue the workout displayed, or create a new workout. Once you've entered new information, continue to add new workout information, start a new workout, or visit the dashboard to see workout data.
